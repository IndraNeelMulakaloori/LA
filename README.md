# CLAW

**CLA** sounds like **Claw**  is a C++ Linear algebra library built for numerical computation of vectors and matrices

- OOPs is implemented

Features:
- CRUD of a Matrix data structure
- Creation of Identity matrix
- Matrix Multiplication
- LU Decompostion with partial pivoting
- Vstack, Hstack, identity, zero/one matrices
- **rref** or Reduced-row echeleon form  of a matrix
<!-- - Can find inverse with vstack and rref (will be implementing)
- Solving Ax =b and Ax =0 with stacking
- Rank, Nullity of a matrix -->

Future List:
- Orthogonalisation and Determinant finding of a matrix
- Parallel computation to optimise performance
