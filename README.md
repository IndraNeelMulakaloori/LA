# CLAW

**CLA** sounds like **Claw**  is a C++ Linear algebra library built for numerical computation of vectors and matrices

- OOPs is implemented

Features:
- CRUD of a Matrix data structure
- Creation of Identity matrix
- Matrix Multiplication
- LU Decompostion with partial pivoting

Future List:
- Orthogonalisation and Determinant finding of a matrix
- Parallel computation to optimise performance
